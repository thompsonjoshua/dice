  <!--
    Developed by Joshua Thompson on September 14, 2020.
    The design is based on Angela Yu's "The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp" project.
    Most of the html and CSS were already provided since this lesson was focused on JavaScript work on the Document Object Model, which I provided myself.
    Within the HTML and CSS, I:
      changed the colors, dice images, emoji images, and footer.
      added the media query and all associated features as well as the random rotation angle of the dice.
